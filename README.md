# DataScienceProjects-Bengaluru_House_Price
This data science project explains the steps necessary to build a website to predict real estate prices. Using banglore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com, we will first build a model using Sklearn and linear regression. As a second step, we would write a Python flask server that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests. In the third component, the user will enter home square feet area, bedrooms, and so on. The website will then seek out the predicted price using Python Flask server. We have cover almost all data science concepts during model building. For example, we will look at data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensional reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, and k fold cross validation.
